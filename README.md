## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting car prices using machine learning techniques to assist in informed decision-making for both buyers and sellers. It begins with importing essential libraries and dependencies, followed by the collection and preprocessing of data. The dataset is inspected to understand its structure, clean missing values, and encode categorical variables like fuel type, seller type, and transmission into numerical formats. Data splitting is performed to create training and testing subsets for model development. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression and Lasso Regression to build predictive models. Various performance metrics are calculated to evaluate and compare the models, ensuring the selection of the most accurate one for car price prediction.

## Project Final Conclusion
The car price prediction project successfully demonstrates how machine learning can be leveraged to provide accurate estimations. Through effective preprocessing and encoding techniques, the dataset was prepared for machine learning applications, ensuring compatibility and reliability. Linear Regression and Lasso Regression were implemented, revealing their capability to handle continuous variables. The evaluation metrics, including R-squared and RMSE, provided insight into the performance and accuracy of the models. Factors such as fuel type, seller type, and transmission were identified as significant contributors to car price variations, emphasizing the importance of these variables in decision-making processes. The use of visualizations enhanced the understanding of data patterns and model outcomes. While the results were promising, the project highlighted some limitations, including the potential impact of outliers and the need for a larger and more diverse dataset to improve generalizability. Overall, this project demonstrates the value of machine learning in price prediction and provides a foundation for future improvements and applications in the automotive industry.
